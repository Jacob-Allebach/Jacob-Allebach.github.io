I am Jacob Allebach, a software engineer and game developer.

I have worked on a few projects in the past which you can find in the projects tab of this site. These include a couple of games made using Processing and Twine 2 as well as a grading application used by Allegheny College. While I don't currently have any other projects to show yet, I hope to have more presentable work in the near future. I am currently learning to develop games in the Unity engine, so the next big project on here will most likely be created through there.
